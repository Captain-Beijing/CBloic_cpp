# CBloic_cpp
command line loic dos tool, just for learning and communicating purpose.

I found out there is this so-called LOIC dos tool written in C# on the internet, and it is based on GUI,
but I didn't find any command-line based loic dos tool on the Internet, so I decided to make my own, but
pay attention to this is only for communication and learning purpose.

Basically some very simple C++ code, and I am denitely not a professionall coder and also new to this,
so there might be some place not that good, if you have any suggestions to make it better, feel free
to say. 

Command-line tool means it is less resouce consuming and can run in OS without GUI support, that is why
I wrote it.

Again, I am a coding and tech amateur, so not big on good coding style or nice comment etc, if you have
any question, also feel free to ask, I will respond accordingly.


# USAGE
